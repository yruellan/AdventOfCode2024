# Advent of Code 2024

## Introduction

This is a repository for my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles. I will be using Python to solve the puzzles. 

The puzzles can be found at [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/).

I use my own library of classic functions to solve the puzzles. The library is the `lib.py` file.

Files are named `dayXXY.py` where `XX` is the day of the puzzle and `Y` is `a` or `b`, depending on the part of the puzzle. The input files are named `dataXX.txt`.
